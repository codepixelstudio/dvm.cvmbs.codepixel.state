    <p>

        Your curriculum provides education and training that emphasize case-based and hands-on learning during all four years. You will progressively advance in knowledge and application of normal biology, pathophysiology, clinical medicine, surgery, clinical reasoning, and professional skills. Youâ€™ll spend your first and second years primarily in classrooms; your third and fourth years will be highlighted by clinical rotation at the James L. Voss Veterinary Teaching Hospital
